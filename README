BOOST TOGGLE INDICATOR
----------------------

A simple tray icon tool to toggle CPU boost on supported Linux systems.

This tool uses the Linux cpu-freq driver to check and control the current CPU boost status, displaying it via a AppIndicator tray icon. You can toggle boost with a single click plus submitting your password â€” privilege elevation is handled via pkexec. The current boost state is saved to disk and restored on the next boot.

When the boost status is disabled, CPU frequency is limited to the base clock leading to lower temperatures and saving power. Depending on the CPU this can incur a significant performance hit.

--------------------------
Dependencies/requirements:
--------------------------

Shell with AppIndicator support, libayatana-appindicator3, Python 3, and pkexec via policykit (for privilege elevation). Tested on Ubuntu with the Ubuntu AppIndicators extension enabled. Install all deps via the following command:

sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 \
                 gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1 libayatana-appindicator3-1 \
                 policykit-1

Installation:
-------------

You can just run the Python script (boost_toggle_indicator) directly 
from the directory you extracted it to.

However, if you want the program to run at startup and restore your 
previous boost status, the following steps are required:

	1. Copy boost-toggle-indicator to /usr/local/bin and make it executable:
		
			sudo cp boost-toggle-indicator /usr/local/bin/
			sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/boost-toggle-indicator


	2. copy "boost-toggle-indicator.desktop" to your .config/autostart directory

			cp boost-toggle-indicator.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
			

	Recommended: 

    3. The program uses icons to clearly display the boost status.
	   It expects to find the icons folder either in the current directory, 
	   in .local/share/boost-toggle or in /usr/share/boost-toggle. 
	   If the icons are not found, the program will fallback to a generic CPU icon.
	   
	   Thus, for a single-user installation:

			mkdir ~/.local/share/boost-toggle
			cp -r icons ~/.local/share/boost-toggle/
			
	Optional: 

    4. To make the utility searchable and executable for standard launchers
	
			sudo cp boost-toggle-indicator.desktop /usr/share/applications/
